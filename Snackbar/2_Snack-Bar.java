The `Snackbar` component in the `@react-native-material/core` library is used to display brief messages to inform users about app processes or notifications. Snackbars are typically displayed temporarily at the bottom of the screen and don't require user input to disappear. They are a common way to provide feedback or alerts without interrupting the user experience.

Here's a breakdown of the props and usage of the `Snackbar` component:

```jsx
import { Snackbar } from "@react-native-material/core";
```

### Props

1. **message** (string, required): This prop specifies the main message text to be displayed in the snackbar. It's the primary content of the snackbar.

2. **action** (React.ReactElement, optional): The `action` prop allows you to add an action button or element to the snackbar. When the user interacts with this action, you can perform a specific action, like dismissing the snackbar or triggering another function.

### Usage

Let's explore two examples to understand how to use the `Snackbar` component:

#### Example 1: Simple Snackbar

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { View } from "react-native";
import { Snackbar } from "@react-native-material/core";

const App = () => (
  <View style={{ flex: 1 }}>
    <Snackbar
      message="Can't send the photo."
      style={{ position: "absolute", start: 16, end: 16, bottom: 16 }}
    />
  </View>
);

export default App;
```

In this example, we have a basic `Snackbar` component with just the `message` prop set. The snackbar will display the message "Can't send the photo." at the bottom of the screen.

#### Example 2: Snackbar with Action Button

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { View } from "react-native";
import { Snackbar, Button } from "@react-native-material/core";

const App = () => (
  <View style={{ flex: 1 }}>
    <Snackbar
      message="This is a two-line message with an action button."
      action={<Button variant="text" title="Dismiss" color="#BB86FC" compact />}
      style={{ position: "absolute", start: 16, end: 16, bottom: 16 }}
    />
  </View>
);

export default App;
```

In this example, the `Snackbar` component includes both the `message` and `action` props. It displays the message "This is a two-line message with an action button." and provides an action button labeled "Dismiss." When the "Dismiss" button is clicked, you can perform a specific action, such as dismissing the snackbar.

Remember to adjust the styles and positioning according to your app's design requirements.

These examples should give you a good starting point for using the `Snackbar` component in the `@react-native-material/core` library to provide feedback or notifications to your users in a user-friendly and unobtrusive way.
