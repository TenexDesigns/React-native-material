The Snackbars component from react-native-material is a component that can be used to display a snackbar. Snackbars are typically used to display a brief message about an app process, such as a confirmation message or an error message.

To use the Snackbars component, simply import it into your component and then add it to your render function. The Snackbars component has a few props that you can use to customize it, such as the message prop and the action prop.

The message prop is the text of the snackbar. The action prop is an element that is displayed to the right of the snackbar text. This can be a button, a text link, or any other element.

Here is an example of how to use the Snackbars component:

JavaScript
import React from "react";
import { View } from "react-native";
import { Snackbar } from "@react-native-material/core";

const App = () => (
  <View style={{ flex: 1 }}>
    <Snackbar message="Can't send the photo." />
  </View>
);

export default App;

You can also use the Snackbars component to display a snackbar with an action button. For example, the following code will render a snackbar with the text "This is a two-line message with an action button." and a dismiss button:

JavaScript
import React from "react";
import { View } from "react-native";
import { Snackbar, Button } from "@react-native-material/core";

const App = () => (
  <View style={{ flex: 1 }}>
    <Snackbar
      message="This is a two-line message with an action button."
      action={<Button variant="text" title="Dismiss" color="#BB86FC" compact />}
    />
  </View>
);

export default App;
