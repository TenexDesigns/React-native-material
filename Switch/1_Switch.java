The Switch component from react-native-material is a component that can be used to display a switch. Switches are typically used to toggle the state of a single item on or off, such as a notification setting or a dark mode setting.

To use the Switch component, simply import it into your component and then add it to your render function. The Switch component has a few props that you can use to customize it, such as the value prop, the onValueChange prop, and the disabled prop.

The value prop is the current state of the switch. The onValueChange prop is a function that is called when the state of the switch changes. The disabled prop is a boolean that determines whether the switch is disabled or not.

Here is an example of how to use the Switch component:

JavaScript
import React, { useState } from "react";
import { Switch } from "@react-native-material/core";

const App = () => {
  const [checked, setChecked] = useState(true);
  return (
    <Switch value={checked} onValueChange={() => setChecked(!checked)} />
  );
};

export default App;

This code will render a switch that is currently toggled on. When the user taps on the switch, the onValueChange function will be called and the state of the switch will be toggled to off.

You can also use the Switch component in conjunction with other components, such as the ListItem component. For example, the following code will render two list items with switches:

JavaScript
import React, { useState } from "react";
import { ListItem, Switch } from "@react-native-material/core";

const App = () => {
  const [checked, setChecked] = useState(true);
  const [enabled, setEnabled] = useState(true);
  return (
    <>
      <ListItem
        title="List Item"
        trailing={
          <Switch value={checked} onValueChange={() => setChecked(!checked)} />
        }
        onPress={() => setChecked(!checked)}
      />
      <ListItem
        title="List Item"
        trailing={
          <Switch value={enabled} onValueChange={() => setEnabled(!enabled)} />
        }
        onPress={() => setEnabled(!enabled)}
      />
      <ListItem title="List Item" trailing={<Switch disabled />} disabled />
    </>
  );
};

export default App;
Use code with caution. Learn more
This code will render two list items with switches. The first list item will have a switch that is currently toggled on. The second list item will have a switch that is currently toggled off. The third list item will have a switch that is disabled.

The Switch component can be used in a variety of ways. It is a good idea to use the Switch component whenever you want to provide a user with the ability to toggle the state of a single item on or off.

Here are some examples of how to use the Switch component:

Toggle a notification setting
Toggle a dark mode setting
Toggle a debugging setting
Toggle a setting that controls whether a feature is enabled or disabled
