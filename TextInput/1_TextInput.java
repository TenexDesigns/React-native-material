The TextInput component from react-native-material is a component that can be used to display a text input. Text inputs are typically used to allow users to enter text, such as their name, email address, or password.

To use the TextInput component, simply import it into your component and then add it to your render function. The TextInput component has a few props that you can use to customize it, such as the variant prop, the label prop, the leading prop, and the trailing prop.

The variant prop determines the style of the text input. There are three variants available: filled, outlined, and standard. The filled variant is the default variant. The outlined variant has a thin outline around the text input. The standard variant is a simple text input with no outline or border.

The label prop is the text that is displayed above the text input. The leading prop is the element that is displayed to the left of the text input. The trailing prop is the element that is displayed to the right of the text input.

Here is an example of how to use the TextInput component:

JavaScript
import React from "react";
import { TextInput } from "@react-native-material/core";

const App = () => <TextInput label="Label" style={{ margin: 16 }} />;

export default App;

This code will render a text input with the label "Label". The text input will have a default style.

You can also use the TextInput component to display a text input with a specific variant. For example, the following code will render a text input with the outlined variant:

JavaScript
import React from "react";
import { TextInput } from "@react-native-material/core";

const App = () => (
 <TextInput variant="outlined" label="Label" style={{ margin: 16 }} />
);

export default App;

You can also use the TextInput component to display a text input with leading and trailing elements. For example, the following code will render a text input with a leading icon and a trailing button:

JavaScript
import React from "react";
import { TextInput, Icon, Button } from "@react-native-material/core";

const App = () => (
 <TextInput
   label="Label"
   leading={<Icon name="search" />}
   trailing={
     <Button variant="primary" title="Submit" />
    }
   style={{ margin: 16 }}
  />
);

export default App;

The TextInput component can be used in a variety of ways. It is a good idea to use the TextInput component whenever you want to allow users to enter text.

Here are some examples of how to use the TextInput component:

Display a text input in a form to allow users to enter their name, email address, or password.
Display a text input in a search bar to allow users to search for something.
Display a text input in a comment box to allow users to leave a comment.
