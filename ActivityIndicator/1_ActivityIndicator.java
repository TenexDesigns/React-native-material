The `ActivityIndicator` component from `react-native-material` is a component that can be used to display a loading spinner. It is a good idea to use the `ActivityIndicator` component whenever your app is performing an action that takes a long time to complete, such as fetching data from a server or saving data to a database. This will let the user know that the app is still working and has not crashed.

To use the `ActivityIndicator` component, simply import it into your component and then add it to your render function. The `ActivityIndicator` component has a few props that you can use to customize it, such as the `color` prop and the `size` prop.

Here is an example of how to use the `ActivityIndicator` component:

```javascript
import React from "react";
import { ActivityIndicator } from "@react-native-material/core";

const App = () => (
  <ActivityIndicator />
     <ActivityIndicator size="small" color="error" />
    <ActivityIndicator size="large" color="#00ff00" />
);

export default App;
```

This code will render a loading spinner in the center of the screen.

You can also use the `ActivityIndicator` component to display a loading spinner next to a button or other component. For example, the following code will display a loading spinner next to a button that is fetching data from a server:

```javascript
import React from "react";
import { ActivityIndicator, Button } from "@react-native-material/core";

const App = () => (
  <Button title="Fetch data" loading>
    <ActivityIndicator size="small" />
  
  </Button>
);

export default App;
```

The `ActivityIndicator` component is a versatile component that can be used in a variety of ways. It is a good idea to use the `ActivityIndicator` component whenever your app is performing an action that takes a long time to complete.

Here is a summary of the props that you can use to customize the `ActivityIndicator` component:

* `color`: The color of the spinner.
* `size`: The size of the spinner.
* `loading`: A boolean value that indicates whether the spinner is loading.
* `style`: An object that contains CSS styles for the spinner.
